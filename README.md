# Russian Wiktionary HTML dump parser

This parses the Russian Wiktionary using the HTML dump that can be found [here](https://dumps.wikimedia.org/other/enterprise_html/). 

### Installation
Then should clone the project, install poetry and then run `poetry install`. 

Then run `poetry run python ./ruwiktionary_htmldump_parser\parse_wiktionary.py` to parse the dictionary into a JSON file

# Additional info
Be aware that for me on Windows the HTML dumps could only be unpacked using Winrar and not 7-zip
